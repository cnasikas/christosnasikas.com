<h2>About</h2>

<section>
  <p>
    My name is Christos Nasikas. I like <a href="https://github.com/cnasikas/"
    target="_blank">building software</a>, cryptography, security, blockchain,
    and privacy. I hold a Masterâ€™s Degree in Theoretical Computer Science from the <a href="http://di.uoa.gr/"
    target="_blank">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the past years I worked as a self-employed Full Stack Web Developer. Throughout a period of over three years I collaborated with numerous companies and individuals (<a href="https://www.roleplay.gr/" target="_blank">Roleplay</a>,
      <a href="http://moystudio.gr/en/" target="_blank">MoY Studio</a>, <a href="http://lambandlamp.com" target="_blank">Lamb and Lamp</a>,

  Later on, I was recruited as a Software Engineer and Researcher by the <a href="https://www.athena-innovation.gr/" target="_blank">Athena Research Information Center</a>. There I designed and developed a distributed privacy preserving data analytics platform. For the needs of the project, I build various distributed scalable components using Node.js and designed communication protocols as state machines. I also designed and developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, developed a web app using React and Redux, and build a data adaptive processing module using Python.
