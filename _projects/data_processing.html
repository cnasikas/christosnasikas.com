<p>
In this project we propose a protocol for data processing
where data controllers can register their datasets and entities can request data
processing operations by data processors. A distributed ledger is used as the controller of
the system serving as an immutable history log of all actions taken by the participants. The
blockchain-based distributed ledger provides data accountability, auditability and provenance
tracking. We also use a Zero Knowledge Verifiable Computation scheme where
a data processor is enforced to produce a proof of correctness of computation without
revealing the dataset itself that the requestor verifies. This records the fact that correct
processing has taken place without disclosing any information about the data.
