<p>
  My Health My Data (MHMD) is a Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action which aims to change the way sensitive data are shared.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.athena-innovation.gr/en">ATHENA RC</a> was to build a Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) Infrastructure
  where a researcher can request for secure computations over specific datasets. The system is composed of three main entities: coordinator, smpc node, and data provider node.
  The components are sychronized by the coordinator by running a distributed protocol.
</p>
<p>
  Our core MPC system lies in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SCALE-MAMBA">SCALE-MAMBA</a>. SCALE-MAMBA assumes that the data
  are in the same server with the secure computation node meaning that external data providers are not supported. Having the ability to
  support external data providers is crucial as light nodes can participate to a computation request without the need to have
  heavy infrastructure to deploy and maintain a computation node.
  Based on <a target="_blank" href="https://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/10_Damgaard.pdf">Confidential Benchmarking based on Multiparty Computation</a> we
  extend <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SCALE-MAMBA">SCALE-MAMBA</a> to support <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/athenarc/SCALE-MAMBA">external data providers</a>.
  Data providers send their data encrypted and each computation node takes a share (based on a secret share scheme) of the data. Νο computation node have access
  to the raw data. Our protocol is designed and developed as a finite state machine where client and server change states and act
  based on various events. The protocol is implemented in C++.
