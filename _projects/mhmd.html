  My Health My Data (MHMD) is a Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action which aims to change the way sensitive data are shared.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.athena-innovation.gr/en">ATHENA RC</a> was to build a Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) Infrastructure
  where a researcher can request for secure computations over specific datasets. The system is composed of three main entities: coordinator, smpc node, and data provider node.
</p>
<p>
  Our core MPC system lies in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SCALE-MAMBA">SCALE-MAMBA</a>. SCALE-MAMBA assumes that the data
  are in the same server with the secure computation node meaning that external data providers are not supported. Having the ability to
  support external data providers is crucial as light nodes can participate to a computation request without the need to have
  heavy infrastructure to deploy and maintain a computation node.
  Based on <a target="_blank" href="https://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/10_Damgaard.pdf">Confidential Benchmarking based on Multiparty Computation</a> we
  extend <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SCALE-MAMBA">SCALE-MAMBA</a> to support <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/athenarc/SCALE-MAMBA">external data providers</a>.
  Data providers send their data encrypted and each computation node takes a share (based on a secret share scheme) of the data. Νο computation node have access
  to the raw data. Our protocol is designed and developed as a finite state machine where client and server change states and act
  based on various events. The protocol is implemented in C++.
</p>
<p>
  The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/athenarc/smpc-coordinator">coordinator</a> is responsible for accepting computation requests (through a RESTful API) and coordinate data providers
  and computation nodes (with the use of WebSockets) during the execution and fulfillment of the request. The coordinator is implemented in NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/athenarc/smpc-player" target="_blank">SMPC computation node</a> is responsible for compiling MPC programs and initiate
  SCALE-MAMBA nodes. It always acts as instructed by the coordinator. The SMPC computation node is implemented in NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/athenarc/smpc-local-driver" target="_blank">data provider node</a> is responsible for preparing the dataset in a suitable
  form as needed for the importer and initiate the client node of the importer. It always acts as instructed by the coordinator.
  The SMPC computation node is implemented in NodeJS and the data processing module in Python.
